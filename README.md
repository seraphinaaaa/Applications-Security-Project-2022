# Applications-Security-Project-2022

As apart of the Year 2 curriculum in Nanyang Polytechnic, under the module Applications Security Project, my team and I built a blog website.

Using methods, processes, tools, and technologies to develop secured and security-enabled software applications that we were taught, my team and I created a blog website that met confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs, as well as authentication, non-repudiation, and authorization requirements.
